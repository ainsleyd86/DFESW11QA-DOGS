DFESW11QA-DOGS API

-------------

WHY?

This project was completed as a result of the learning done throughout the software development bootcamp. This is a SpringBoot API with CRUD functionality utilising  API Development (Spring Boot),  Programming software (Java), Agile & Project Management (Git, Jira), Databases & Cloud (H2, MySQL) and Testing (JUnit). I've made it so the breeder(user) can input/delete and update their dogs from which they have.

How I expected the challenge to go?

I expected to have my understanding of Java and Spring Boot to be pushed to the limits, which it was. As this is something completely new and foreign to me i found it confusing and only really started getting the hang of it towards the end of the week. Having time off throughout the course played a massive part in hindering my learning and understanding. In particular I had to make sure that all the learning videos were watched and then if I had any difficulties I would then go to external sources such as youtube to help clear it up. 

-------------

What went well? What didn't go as planned?

-------------

i think overall the whole thing went well, given the parts that i missed out on. i understood almost everything from weeks 1-5/6. i found the learning was easy as i was at home and the tutors was very very engaging and helpful. The parts that werent so good was the java sections (the main chunk of it). luckily the tutor and a fellow member on the course took time to talk me through it and help me when and where i needed it. i managed to get a good understanding of it all (although theres still a fair bit of cinfusion) but time has restricted me to how much i could get done.

-------------

Any improvements for the project next time?

-------------

i could definitely have my code looking neater and maybe a bit more formatted. if i had time to understand more i would defintely add some more bells and whistels instead of just the basics.
