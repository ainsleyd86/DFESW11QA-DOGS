DFESW11QA-DOGS API

----------
WHY?

This project was completed as a result of the learning done throughout the software development bootcamp. 
This is a SpringBoot API with CRUD functionality utilising API Development (Spring Boot), Programming software (Java), 
Agile & Project Management (Git, Jira), Databases & Cloud (H2, MySQL) and Testing (JUnit). 
I've made it so the breeder(user) can input/delete and update their dogs from which they have.

----------
How I expected the challenge to go?

I expected to have my understanding of Java and Spring Boot to be pushed to the limits, which it was. 
As this is something completely new and foreign to me i found it confusing and only really started getting the hang of it towards the end of the week. 
Having time off throughout the course played a massive part in hindering my learning and understanding. 
In particular I had to make sure that all the learning videos were watched and then if I had any difficulties,
I would then go to external sources such as youtube to help clear it up.

----------
What went well? What didn't go as planned?

i think overall the whole thing went well, given the parts that i missed out on. 
i understood almost everything from weeks 1-5/6. i found the learning was easy as i was at home and the tutors was very very engaging and helpful. i managed to get an understanding of postman,spring and the majority of java via intellij.
The parts that werent so good was some of the java sections and testing, i didnt manage to get round to using mockito. 
Luckily the tutor and a fellow member on the course took time to talk me through it and help me when and where i needed it. 
I managed to get a good understanding of it all (although theres still a fair bit of cinfusion) but time has restricted me to how much i could get done.
i was unable to add a .jar file as my tests were failing and i managed 53% coverage. (see screenshots)

----------
Any improvements for the project next time?

i could definitely have my code looking neater and maybe a bit more formatted. 
if i had time to understand more i would defintely add some more bells and whistels instead of just the basics.
